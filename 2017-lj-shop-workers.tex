%% Statement of Objects and Reasons
\begin{sor}
\item The Maharashtra Shops and Establishments Act (LXXIX of 1948) is
  enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the regulation
  of conditions of work and employment in shops, commercial
  establishments, residential hotels, restaurants, eating houses,
  theatres, other places of public amusement or entertainment and
  other establishments.

\item The recent information and technology have revolutionized the
  mode of trading whereby it is possible to sell goods and services
  online without any physical, and geographical limitations and time
  limitations being available for twenty-four hours. Therefore, the
  provisions of the said Act of keeping a shop or establishment closed
  for a business on one day of the week and to restrict the opening
  and closing hours of establishments have become obsolete.  It has
  become necessary to provide even platform for offline business to
  compete with online business and to permit to operate shops and
  establishments for twenty-four hours and all days in a week. It will
  help employment generation at large and to increase Gross Domestic
  Product.

\item In line with the "ease of doing business" policy of the
  Government, it is necessary that the marginal and small
  establishments engaging less than ten employees need to be
  liberalized from registration under the Act and to provide all the
  services under the Act online based on self-declaration and
  self-certified documents.  It is also necessary that the employees
  in the shops and establishments should have uniform working
  conditions. All the welfare measures should be applicable to workers
  so as to improve their health and well being which in turn will
  increase their productivity. Also due to the increase in the
  literacy percentage of women, numerous avenues for job and
  employment for women workers are available. Allowing them to work in
  night shift on par with that of men workers subject to certain
  reasonable terms and conditions particularly regarding their health,
  safety and honour will increase their earning capacity resulting in
  their empowerment.

\item The Central Government has also circulated a model Shops and
  Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service)
  Bill, 2016, which has been finalised after detailed deliberations
  and consultation process, to all the State Governments for
  consideration.

\item In view of the above, the Government of Maharashtra considered
  it expedient to enact a new law, on the lines of the model Bill
  circulated by the Central Government, for regulation of conditions
  of employment and other conditions of service of workers employed in
  various establishments by repealing the existing Maharashtra Shops
  and Establishments Act.

\item The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.
